Questions and answers for interative activity during the first seminar on Machine Learning for HDR (Higher Research Degree) students.

### Question 1:

**Context**: You are researching consumer behavior patterns to identify potential market segments. You have a large dataset of consumer purchases, demographics, and browsing history.

**What do you want the machine learning system to do?**

A) Identify natural clusters or dimensions in the data.

B) Learn what actions to take in different situations.

**What type of learning is appropriate?**

1. Unsupervised Learning

2. Supervised Learning

3. Machine Learning is not useful

**Answer**:
- **A) Identify natural clusters or dimensions in the data.**
- **1. Unsupervised Learning**

**Explanation**: Unsupervised learning, such as clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans), is appropriate when you want to identify natural groupings or patterns in the data without predefined labels. This helps in segmenting the market into different consumer groups based on their behavior.

### Question 2:

**Context**: You are a PhD student researching gene expression patterns in different cell types. You have a large dataset of gene expression levels from various experiments.

**What do you want the machine learning system to do?**

A) Identify natural clusters or dimensions in the data.

B) Learn what actions to take in different situations.

**What type of learning is appropriate?**

1. Unsupervised Learning

2. Supervised Learning

3. Machine Learning is not useful

**Answer**:
- **A) Identify natural clusters or dimensions in the data.**
- **1. Unsupervised Learning**

**Explanation**: Unsupervised learning, such as clustering, can help identify natural groupings of gene expression patterns, revealing potentially new cell types or states without predefined labels.

### Question 3:

**Context**: You are working on a healthcare project where you have patient data, including medical history, treatment plans, and outcomes. You want to predict the most effective treatment for new patients based on their medical history.

**What do you want the machine learning system to do?**

A) Identify natural clusters or dimensions in the data.

B) Learn what actions to take in different situations.

**What type of learning is appropriate?**

1. Unsupervised Learning

2. Supervised Learning

3. Machine Learning is not useful

**Answer**:
- **B) Learn what actions to take in different situations.**
- **2. Supervised Learning**

**Explanation**: Supervised learning is used to predict outcomes based on labeled data. In this case, you can use historical patient data to train a model that predicts the most effective treatment for new patients, given their medical history.

### Question 4:

**Context**: You are analyzing customer reviews for a new product to find out what features customers like or dislike. You have a large set of text reviews.

**What do you want the machine learning system to do?**

A) Identify natural clusters or dimensions in the data.

B) Learn what actions to take in different situations.

**What type of learning is appropriate?**

1. Unsupervised Learning

2. Supervised Learning

3. Machine Learning is not useful

**Answer**:
- **A) Identify natural clusters or dimensions in the data.**
- **1. Unsupervised Learning**

**Explanation**: Unsupervised learning, such as topic modeling or clustering, can help identify common themes or sentiments in customer reviews without needing labeled data. This helps understand what features customers like or dislike.

### Question 5:

**Context**: You have a large dataset of emails and you want to sort them into different categories (spam, promotions, social, etc.).

**What do you want the machine learning system to do?**

A) Identify natural clusters or dimensions in the data.

B) Learn what actions to take in different situations.

**What type of learning is appropriate?**

1. Unsupervised Learning

2. Supervised Learning

3. Machine Learning is not useful

**Answer**:
- **B) Learn what actions to take in different situations.**
- **2. Supervised Learning**

**Explanation**: Supervised learning can be used to classify emails into different categories based on labeled training data. Algorithms like decision trees or support vector machines can be trained on examples of labeled emails to predict the category of new emails.

### Question 6:

**Context**: You are managing an industrial process and want to detect any anomalies in real-time sensor data to prevent equipment failure.

**What do you want the machine learning system to do?**

A) Identify natural clusters or dimensions in the data.

B) Learn what actions to take in different situations.

**What type of learning is appropriate?**

1. Unsupervised Learning

2. Supervised Learning

3. Machine Learning is not useful

**Answer**:
- **A) Identify natural clusters or dimensions in the data.**
- **1. Unsupervised Learning**

**Explanation**: Unsupervised learning can be used to detect anomalies in sensor data by identifying patterns that deviate significantly from normal behavior. Techniques like clustering or anomaly detection can be employed to monitor the industrial process.

### Question 7:

**Context**: You are a researcher with a very limited dataset on a niche topic. You want to develop a robust predictive model based on this data.

**What do you want the machine learning system to do?**

A) Identify natural clusters or dimensions in the data.

B) Learn what actions to take in different situations.

**What type of learning is appropriate?**

1. Unsupervised Learning

2. Supervised Learning

3. Machine Learning is not useful

**Answer**:
- Given the context, **Machine Learning is not useful** might be the most appropriate choice because:
  - The dataset is too small to train a robust and reliable predictive model.
  - Manual analysis or qualitative methods might be more suitable for such a niche and limited dataset.

**Explanation**: Machine learning algorithms typically require a substantial amount of data to be effective. In cases where the dataset is very limited, traditional research methods may provide more accurate and meaningful insights.
